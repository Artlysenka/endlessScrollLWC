# Endless scroll for LWC
Custom list view component with endless scroll on LWC for Salesforce

This component is designed for Contact object, but can be implemented for any other object. It has only basic functionality : displaying the list of contacts, loading new conacts when we scroll to the bottom of the page and redirecting to the contact page when we click on a specific contact.
